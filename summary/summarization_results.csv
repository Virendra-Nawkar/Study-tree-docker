TF-IDF Extractive,"Global temperatures have risen by approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial era. The Paris Agreement, signed
by nearly 200 countries, aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Individual actions, such as
reducing energy consumption and supporting sustainable practices, also play a crucial role in addressing
climate change.",71.43,28.71,30.7,0.002
TextRank Extractive,"The primary cause of this warming is the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide,
from human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Governments worldwide are working to implement
policies to reduce emissions and transition to renewable energy sources. The transition to a low-carbon economy presents both challenges and opportunities,
potentially creating millions of new jobs in renewable energy and green technology sectors.",64.29,15.94,35.96,0.004
